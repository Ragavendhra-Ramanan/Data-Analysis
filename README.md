# Data-Analysis
In this Notebook, We will be performing data analysis in the domain of Car Leasing. The Goal of this Analysis is to predict the Price of Car given various features associated with the car. Here we would be performing end to end data analysis and based on the analysis, most important features which contribute to car price would be selected. These selected features are further used for prediction.This Notebook will not cover existing ML models to perform the task of prediction rather we would be using Rule based prediction.

The dataset of used cars consists of about 371528 data points and 20 features. The source of this dataset is crawled from German Private company portal and is now made available to public.In this analysis ,we would be performing following tasks.

1. **Importing libraries and data**
2. **Data Cleaning**

4. **Data Preprocessing**
5. **Feature Analysis**
6. **Rule Based Prediction**
